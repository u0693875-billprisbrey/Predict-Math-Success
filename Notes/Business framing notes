WHY DOES THE MATH DEP'T WANT EVERYONE TO TAKE A MATH PLACEMENT TEST?    

WHY DOESN'T THE UNIVERSITY WANT EVERYONE TO TAKE A MATH  PLACEMENT TEST?   

What is at play here --- student success outcomes, or burden of placement testing?

And what student success outcomes are we looking at?

  Do we want more students with an A in their math  class of choice?  In that case, we'd recommend a lower math class so they get an A, fulfill their math req't, and graduate sooner.
  
  What are we balancing here -- what if students choose a class that is too low?  What if they choose too high?
  
  Are we rewarding risk (takinga harder class) or suppressing it (pushing people into lower classes)?

I'd like to unwind from the very ending, and possibly look at student course feedback.

We surely have enough people to do a lot of "twin" comparisons -- that is, two students with the same ACT math scores.  One graduated in 4 yrs, one in 6 yrs.  Can we unwind the differences?

I'm curious in the exceptions -- does someone have a really low ACT and a really high ALEKS score?  If so, which one was predictive?   Which one trumped?

How obvious are the obvious cases, the clear-cut cases?  What are the "edge" cases, with uncertainty?  

Validating the current Year One math recommendations is a little different request.  We can see all the people who met the recommendations, and how they fared.  

Why are people taking lower math classes than their abilities?  How often does that happen?
