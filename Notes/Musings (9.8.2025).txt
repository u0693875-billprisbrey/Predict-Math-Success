I'd like to find math course sequences
I'd like to look at the avg grade per instructor
Which ones are taken in Yr 1?  By FTF?

In course sequences, what predicts the later grades?

Am I limited to UAIR data?  Can I see what else is in SDW/BIPR?

Cough up your course sequencing work

Cough up DFWI work -- I converted the grades to ordinals, right?

Propose a graph database

Is there any point in doing clustering, and -then- seeing which cluster has the highest GPA?

I also need to review Whitney notes and watch the training videos.  (Transcribe them?)

What's the degree of coordination with Whitney?  On this whole project?  It's not my place to organize it, so . . . .  should I?  What if I don't?

I'd like to, in the context of the math courses ---

lots of aggregations and tables.

figure out GPA distribution per course

aggregate GPA per instructor + course

what's the highest section count

capacity distribution (absolute and percentage)

repeat courses per student

do I have any "50" level courses?

number of students.  

Aggregate number of classes per student
