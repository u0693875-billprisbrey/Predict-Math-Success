Musing on the first two models
9.25.2025

Historically, math placement has used high school transcripts and math placement tests.  I don't have access to either of those.

What I can do is --- 
  First, predict course placement.
  Second, use that course placement and predict "W/I" or "Grade" category.
  Filter out all predicted "W/I" values and run a second model
  Third, convert grades to ordinal values and predict grades
  Fourth, combine predictions ("W/I" and grade ordinal) for the final grade

I should include the year as a prediction category.	

If I am doing just grades, then I should consider re-balancing (probably "up sample")

Are these math courses "ordinal" -- does one build on the previous one?  Or do they cover different skill sets?

I'd like to do the "variable placement" and the SHAP values.

...but I'm feeling a bit weaker about the whole enterprise, honestly.

In the system I'm using to predict, there's a hidden intelligent decider that is trying to counter-act the various forces.	

TO DO:
- Add "S" to extract filter
- Figure out CATNBR
- Are math courses ORDINAL?
- Convert grades into category (I/W vs ordinal), predict on IW, then predict on ordinal grades
- Add year
- Add pre/during/post COVID marker (?)  Has grading really changed before-and-after?
