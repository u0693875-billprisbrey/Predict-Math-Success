Check In: Math Placement
9.26.2025

ACTION ITEMS:  
 - Team to keep work folders private and share ready-to-share documents into the U drop box folder "Math Placement"
 - Whitney to share her queries with Bill next week for his comparison
 - Meet Next Friday for the next follow-up

SUMMARY:
  - Whitney walks through her queries, showing that most freshman take the math classes in their first year and that we are missing either ACT or high school GPA for a lot of students.	
  - Bill asks questions about data:
	* Needs to include "S" in his extract filter
 	* Filtering for math labs looks correct
	* Grade "E" stands for "F"ailure
	* Whitney shares link to the catalog: https://catalog.utah.edu/
  - Bill shares his results:  poor prediction on a very small sample; density plots showing majority of classes taken in the first year; hierarchical clustering that identified the ten high volume classes

  - Team discusses:  
	- Split the grades into binary prediction class at C-minus or greater and at D-plus or lesser.
	- Leadership wants to be led step-by-step and problems may not be worth a deeper dive until we are asked follow-up questions.
	- Causal inference may be appropriate if people believe that poor math performance is causitive and not just predictive of student success; however this question can be kicked down the road if leadership interest persists.
